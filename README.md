Exercises from Prata's C++ Primer Plus

The files in this repository are the Programming Exercises at the end of the each
chapter of Stephen Prata C++ Primer Plus. I am using this to learn C++, and will 
be adding to it as I go through the book.  All of the development is being performed
in Eclipse on Mac OSX El Capitan. Project names simply refer to the chapter and 
exercise numbers.  Those that are more descriptive are samples from the text that
I wanted to explore further.
