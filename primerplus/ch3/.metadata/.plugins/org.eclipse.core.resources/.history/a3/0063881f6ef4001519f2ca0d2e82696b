 *  Exercise 5: Write a program that requests the user to enter the
 *  current world population and the current population of the U.S.
 *  (or for some other nation of your choice). Store the information
 *  in variables of type long long. Have the program display the
 *  percent that U.S. (or other nation's) population is of the world's
 *  population. The output should look something like this:
 *
 *  Enter the world's population: 6898758899
 *  Enter the population of the US: 310783781
 *  The population of the US is 4.51492% of the world population.
 *
 *  You can use the Internet to get more recent figures.
