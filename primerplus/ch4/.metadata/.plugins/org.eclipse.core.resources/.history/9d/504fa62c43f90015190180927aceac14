 * Exercise 5:The CandyBar structure contains three members.  The
 * first member holds the brand name of a candy bar.  The second
 * member holds the weight (which may have a fractional part) of the
 * candy bar, and the third member holds the number of calories (an
 * integer value) in the candy bar.  Write a program that declares
 * such a structure and creates a CandyBar variable called snack,
 * initializing its members to "Mocha Munch", 2.3, and 350 respectively.
 * The initialization should be part of the declaration for snack.
 * Finally, the program should display the contents of the snack
 * variable.
