 *	Exercise 3: Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her
 *	first name, and then then constructs, stores, and displays a third
 *	string, consisting of the user's last name, followed by a comma, a
 *	space, and first name.  Use char arrays and functions from the cstring
 *	header file.  A sample run should look like this:
 *
 *	Enter your first name: Flip
 *	Enter your last name: Fleming
 *	Here's the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip
