/*
 * ch4_1.cpp
 *
 * Exercise 1: Write a C++ program that requests and displays information
 * as shown in the following example:
 *
 * What is your first name? Betty Sue
 * What is your last name? Yewe
 * What letter grade do you deserve? B
 * What is your age? 22
 * Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
 * Grade: C
 * Age: 22
 *
 * Note that the program should be able to accept first names that comprise
 * more than one word. Also note that the program adjusts the grade downward
 * -- that is, up one letter. Assume that the user requests an A, a B,
 * or a C so that you don't have to worry about the gap between a D and an F.
