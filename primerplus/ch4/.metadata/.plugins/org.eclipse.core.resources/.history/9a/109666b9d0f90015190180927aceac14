 * Exercise 7: William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service.  For each
 * pizza, he needs the following information:
 * 	*	The name of the pizza company, which can consist of more than
 * 		one word
 * 	*	The diameter of the pizza
 * 	*	The weight of the pizza
 *
 * Devise a structure that can hold this information and write a program
 * that uses a structure variable of that type.  The program should ask
 * the user to enter each of the preceding items of information, and
 * then the program should displau that information.  Use cin (or its
 * methods) and cout.
