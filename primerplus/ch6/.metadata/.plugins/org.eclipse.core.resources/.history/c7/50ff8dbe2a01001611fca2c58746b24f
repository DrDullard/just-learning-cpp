/*
 * ex6_4.cpp
 *
 *  When you join the Benevolent Order of Programmers, you can be
 *  known at BOP meetings by your real name, by your job title, or
 *  by your secret BOP name. Write a program that can list members
 *  by real name, by job title, by secret name, or by a member's
 *  preference.
 *
 *  In the program, create a small array of such structures and
 *  initialize it to suitable values. Have the program run a loop that
 *  lets the user select from different alternatives:
 *
 *  a. display by name			b. display by title
 *  c. display by bopname		d. display by preference
 *  q. quit
 *
 *  Note that "display by preference" does not mean display the
 *  preference member; it means display the member corresponding to
 *  the preference number.  For instance, if preference is 1, choice
 *  d would display the programmers job title. A sample run may look
 *  something like the following:
 *
 *  Benevolent Order of Programmers Report
 *  a. display by name			b. display by title
 *  c. display by bopname		d. display by preference
 *  q. quit
 *  Enter your choice: a
 *  Wimp Macho
 *  Raki Rhodes
 *  Celia Laiter
 *  Hoppy Hipman
 *  Pat Hand
 *  Next Choice: d
 *  Wimp Macho
 *  Junior Programmer
 *  MIPS
 *  Analyst Trainee
 *  LOOPY
 *  Next Choice: q
 *  Bye!
