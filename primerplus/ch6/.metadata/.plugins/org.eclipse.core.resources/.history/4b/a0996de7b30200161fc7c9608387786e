/*
 * ex6_7.cpp
 *
 *	Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q
 *	is entered. The program should then report the number of words that
 *	began with vowels, the number that begin with consonants, and the
 *	number that fit neither of those categories. One approach is to
 *	use isalpha() discriminate between words beginning with letters and
 *	those that don't and then use an if or switch to further identify
 *	those passing the isalpha() test that begin with vowels. A sample
 *	run might look like this:
 *
 *	Enter words (q to quit):
 *	The 12 awesome oxen ambled
 *	quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
 *	5 words begin with vowels
 *	4 words begin with consonants
 *	2 others
