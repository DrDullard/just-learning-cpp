 *	The Kingdom of Neutronia, where the unit of currency is the tvarp,
 *	has the following income tax code:
 *
 *		First 5,000 tvarps: 0% tax
 *		Next 10,000 tvarps: 10% tax
 *		Next 20,000 tvarps: 15% tax
 *		Tvarps after 35,000: 20% tax
 *
 *	For example, someone earning 38000 tvarps would owe 5,000 x 0.00 +
 *	10,000 x 0.10 + 20,000 x 0.15 + 3,000 x 0.20, or 4,600 tvarps.
 *	Write a program what uses a loop to solicit incomes and to report
 *	tax owned.  The loop should terminated when the user enters a
 *	negative number or non-numeric input.
