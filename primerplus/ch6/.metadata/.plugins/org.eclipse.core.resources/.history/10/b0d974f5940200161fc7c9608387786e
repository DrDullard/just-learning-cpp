/*
 * ex6_6.cpp
 *
 *	Put together a program that keeps track of monetary contributions
 *	to the Society for the Preservation of Rightful Influence. It should
 *	ask the user to enter the number of contributors and then solicit
 *	the user to enter the name and contribution of each contributor.
 *	The information should be stored a dynamically allocated array
 *	of structures.  Each structure should have two members: a
 *	character array (or else a string object) to store the name and
 *	a double member to hold the amount of the contribution. After
 *	reading all the data, the program should display the names and
 *	amounts donated for all donors who contributed $10,000 or more.
 *	This list should be headed by the label 'Grand Patrons'. After
 *	that, the program should list the remaining donors. That list
 *	should be headed 'Patrons'. If there are no donors in one of the
 *	categories, the program should print the word "none". Aside from
 *	displaying the two categories, the program need do no sorting.
