 * Exercise 2: Write a program that reads up to 10 donation values into
 * an array of double. (Or, if you prefer, use an array template object.)
 * The program should terminate input on non-numeric input.  It should
 * report the average of the numbers and also report how many numbers
 * in the array are larger than the average.
