 *  Exercise 3: Write precursor to a menu-driven program.  The program
 *  should display a menu offering four choices, each labeled with a
 *  letter. If the user responds with a letter other than one of the
 *  four valid choices, the program should prompt the user to
 *  enter a valid response until the user complies. Then the program
 *  should use a switch to select a simple action based on the user's
 *  selection. A program run should look something like this:
 *
 *  Please enter one of the following choices:
 *  c) carnivore			p) pianist
 *  t) tree					g) game
 *  f
 *  Please enter a c, p, t, or g: q
 *  Please enter a c, p, t, or g: t
 *  A maple is a tree.
