 *
 *	Write a function that takes a reference to a string object as its
 *	parameter and that converts the contents of the string to uppercase.
 *	Use the toupper() function described in Table 6.4 of Chapter 6. Write
 *	a program that uses a loop which allows you test the function with
 *	different input. A sample run might look like this:
 *
 *	Enter a tring (q to quit): go away
 *	GO AWAY
 *	Next string (q to quit): good grief!
 *	GOOD GRIEF!
