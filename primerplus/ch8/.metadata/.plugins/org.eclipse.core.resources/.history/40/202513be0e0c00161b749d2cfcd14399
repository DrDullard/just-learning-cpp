 *
 *	The CandyBar structure three members. The first member holds the
 *	brand name of a candy bar. The second member holds the weight
 *	(which may have a fractional part) of the candy bar, and the third
 *	member holds the number of calories (an integer value) in the
 *	candy bar. Write a program that uses a function that takes as
 *	arguments a reference to CandyBar, a pointer-to-char, a double,
 *	and an int and uses the last three values to set the corresponding
 *	members of the structure. The last three arguments should have the
 *	default values of "Millennium Munch," 2.85, and 350. Also the
 *	program should use a function that takes a reference to a CandyBar
 *	as an argument and displays the contents of the structure. Use
 *	const where appropriate.
