/*
 * ex8_1.cpp
 *
 *	Write a function that takes one argument, the address of a string,
 *	and prints that string once. However, if a second, type int,
 *	argument is provided and is nonzero, the function should print the
 *	string a number of times equal to the number of times that function
 *	has been called at that point. (Note that the number of time the
 *	string is printed is not equal to the value of the second argument;
 *	it is equal to the number of times the function has been called.)
 *	Yes this is a silly function, but it makes you use some of the
 *	techniques discussed in this chapter. Use the function in a simple
 *	program that demonstrates how the function works.
