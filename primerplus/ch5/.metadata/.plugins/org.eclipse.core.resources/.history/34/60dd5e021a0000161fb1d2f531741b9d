 *  Exercise 10: Write a program using nested loops that asks the user
 *  to enter a value for the number of rows to display. It should then
 *  display that many rows of asterisks, with one asterisk in the
 *  first row, two in the second row, and so on. For each row, the
 *  asterisks are preceded by the number of periods needed to make
 *  all the rows display a toal number of characters equal to the
 *  number of rows. A sample run would look like the following:
 *
 *  Enter the number of rows: 5
