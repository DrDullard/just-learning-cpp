 * 	Exercise 7: Design a structure called car that holds the following
 * 	information about an automobile: its make, as a string in a
 * 	character array or in a string object, and the year it was built,
 * 	as an integer. Write a program that asks the user how many cars to
 * 	catalog.  The program should then use new to create a dynamic array
 * 	of that many car structures.  Next, it should prompt the user to
 * 	input the make (which might consist of more than one word) and year
 * 	information for each structure. Note that this requires some care
 * 	because it alternates reading strings with numeric data (see Chapter
 * 	4). Finally, it should display the contents of each structure. A
 * 	sample run should look something like the following:
 *
 * 	How many cars do you wish to catalog? 2
 * 	Car #1:
 * 	Please enter the make: Hudson Hornet
 * 	Please enter the year made: 1952
 * 	Car #2:
 * 	Please enter the make: Kaiser
 * 	Please enter the year made: 1951
 * 	Here is your collection:
 * 	1952 Hudson Hornet
 * 	1951 Kaiser
