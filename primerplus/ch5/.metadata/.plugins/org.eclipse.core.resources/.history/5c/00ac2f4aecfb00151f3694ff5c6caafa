 * Exercise 1: Write a program that requests the user to enter two
 * integers.  This program should then calculate and report the sum
 * of all the integers between and including the two integers. At this
 * point, assume that the smaller integer is entered first.  For
 * example, if the user enters 2 and 9, the program should report that
 * the sum of all the integers from 2 to 9 is 44.
