 *	Exercise 5: You sell the book C++ for Fools.  Write a program that
 *	has you enter a year's worth of Monthly Sales (in terms of number
 *	of books, not of money).  The program should use a loop to prompt
 *	you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of string
 *	objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing
 *	the input data in an array of int. Then, the program should find
 *	the sum of the array contents and report the total sales for the
 *	year.
