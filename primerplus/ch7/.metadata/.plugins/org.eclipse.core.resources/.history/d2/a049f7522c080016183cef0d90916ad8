 *	Write a program that asks the user to enter up to 10 golf scores,
 *	which are to be stored in an array. You should provide a means for
 *	the user to terminate input prior to entering 10 scores. The program
 *	should display all the scores on one line and report the average
 *	score.  Handle input, display, and the average calculation with
 *	three separate array-processing functions.
