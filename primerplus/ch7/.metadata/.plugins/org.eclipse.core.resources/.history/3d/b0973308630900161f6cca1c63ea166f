 *
 *	Many state lotteries use a variation of the simple lottery portrayed
 *	by Listing 7.4. In these variations you choose several numbers from
 *	one set and call them the field numbers.  For example, you might
 *	select five numbers from the field of 1-47.  You also pick a single
 *	number (called a mega number of a powerball, etc.) from a second
 *	range, such as 1-27. To win the grand prize, you have to guess all
 *	picks correctly.  The chance of winning is the product of the
 *	probability of picking all the field numbers times the probability
 *	of picking the mega number. For instance, the probability of winning
 *	the example described here is the product of the probability of
 *	picking 5 out of 47 correctly times the probability of picking 1 out
 *	of 27 correctly. Modify Listing 7.4 to calulate the probability
 *	of winning this kind of lottery.
