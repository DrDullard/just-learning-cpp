 *	Redo Listing 7.15 without using the array class. Do two versions:
 *
 *	(a) Use an ordinary array of const char * for the strings
 *		representing the season names, and use an ordinary array of
 *		double for the expenses.
 *
 *  (b) Use an ordinary array of const char * for the strings
 *  	representing the season names, and use a structure whose
 *  	sole member is an ordinary array of double for the expenses.
 *  	(This design is similar to the basic design of the array class.)
