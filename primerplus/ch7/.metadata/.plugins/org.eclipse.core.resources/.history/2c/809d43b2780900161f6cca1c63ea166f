/*
 * ex7_6.cpp
 *
 *	Write a program that uses the following function:
 *
 *	Fill_array() takes as arguments the name of an array of double
 *	values and an array size.  It prompts the user to enter double
 *	values to be entered in the array. It ceases taking input when
 *	the array is full or when the user enters non-numeric input, and
 *	it returns the actual number of entries.
 *
 *	Show_array() takes as arguments the name of an array of double
 *	values and an array size and displays the contents of the array.
 *
 *	Reverse_array() takes as arguments the name of an array of double
 *	values and an array size and reverses the order of the values
 *	stored in the array.
 *
 *	The program should use these functions to fill an array, show the
 *	array, reverse the array, show the array, reverse all but the first
 *	and last elements of the array, and then show the array.
